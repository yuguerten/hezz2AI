# Hezz2 Game Rules

## Overview
Hezz2 is a famous card game in Morocco for two players or more, combining elements of strategy and luck. The game uses a Spanish deck and features special actions for certain cards.

## Deck
- The game uses a 48-card Spanish deck.
- There are four suits: Bastos (Clubs), Copas (Cups), Espadas (Swords), and Oros (Coins).
- Each suit contains cards numbered 1 through 12.

## Setup
1. Shuffle the deck.
2. Deal 4 cards to each player.
3. Place one card face-up in the center to start the discard pile.
4. The remaining cards form the draw pile.

## Gameplay
1. Players take turns clockwise.
2. On a player's turn, they must do one of the following:
   a. Play a card from their hand that matches either the suit or the number of the top card on the discard pile.
   b. Draw a card from the draw pile if they cannot play a card.
3. The game continues until one player has no cards left in their hand.

## Special Cards
Certain cards have special effects when played:

1. Ace (1): The next player's turn is skipped.
2. Two (2): The next player must draw two cards and their turn is skipped.
3. Seven (7): The player who played this card chooses a new suit that must be followed.

## Winning
The first player to play all the cards from their hand wins the game.

## Additional Rules
- If the draw pile is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile (except for the top card) to create a new draw pile.
- Players must always have at least one card in their hand. If a player is about to play their last card, they must draw one card from the draw pile before playing their last card.

## Strategy Tips
- Keep track of the cards that have been played, especially the special cards.
- Try to save special cards for crucial moments in the game.
- When playing a Seven, choose a suit that you have multiple cards of, or that you think your opponent doesn't have.
- Be mindful of the number of cards in your opponent's hand.
